# Common Country Guitar Chord Progressions

I am learning how to play guitar guitar, and found a site that listed
common chord progressions used in country music
[here](http://www.songwriting-unlimited.com/country-guitar-chords.html#gallery[pageGallery]/0/)

I used it as an excuse to learn GNU Lilypond and typeset the
information I found there. Maybe someone else will find it useful.
